# Facial Emotion Recognition using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to build a facial emotion recognition system using PySpark, a Python library for Apache Spark. This is a course project for Fundamentals of Big Data Analytics at FAST-University, Lahore. Team members: Abdullah Arif and Tahmooras Khan


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have installed/access to:

- Colab (recommended due to ease and nature of python notebook)
- A working installation of Apache Spark (preferably Spark 3.x).
- PySpark installed (`pip install pyspark`).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**: Use `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition-pyspark.git` to clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository using `cd facial-emotion-recognition-pyspark`.

3. **Install dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required Python packages.

4. **Alternate**: You can simply download the `zip` file and upload the image datasets on your google drive and use the `ipynb` on Google Colab.

## Main Steps

### Step 1: Data Preparation

- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction

- Implement feature extraction techniques suitable for image data.

### Step 3: Model Training

- Train the model using the prepared dataset.

### Step 4: Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as f1 score, accuracy, precision and recall.
- Fine-tune the model if necessary.
